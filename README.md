# Growth-Product-Manager-Nanodegree
This is a set of 3 projects completed as part of [Growth Product Manager Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/growth-product-manager-nanodegree--nd037) from Udacity.

The projects are:
1. *Crafting a Growth Loop*. As a Growth Product Manager, I proposed a user acquisition and growth plan for a hypothetical company. As part of the project, a growth loop was built and tested, and an outcome was analysed.
2. *Let It Grow*. Based on the given input data of a hypothetical company, I applied a set of analyses (engagement type analysis, engagement state analysis, retention cohort analysis, retention segment analyses and Churn & LTV analysis) to propose the experiments to improve activation and retention per market segments.
3. *Priceless Penny*. In this project, I build a monetization model for a post-revenue B2B SaaS business. Afterwards, I adjusted the model to a new pricing schema.

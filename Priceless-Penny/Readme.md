# Description
In this project, I built a monetization model for a post-revenue B2B SaaS business and then modified it for a different pricing scheme.
As input data for building monetization schema, a hypothetical company was used with a provided description of the company, its product, pricing scheme, and a dataset of recent months' activity.
Further, based on this model I suggested product improvements that can improve monetization KPIs as well as suggest a change to the pricing scheme.

# Description
In this project, I assumed the role of the Growth Product Manager at Craft Snacks, a hypothetical e-commerce company offering monthly subscriptions of artisan snack boxes. I created a presentation deck to propose a user acquisition and growth plan anchored on the provided business context. The main audience for this presentation is the strategic planning stakeholders across the business, including leadership from marketing, operations, and support. Your goal is to gain business alignment by proposing a growth plan and justifying its rationale. (c) Udacity
